My name is Naveen Bhatia and I thank you for dropping by. I'm a web/cloud/network developer and more recently, a blogger. I have over 18 years of rich experience in engineering robust and efficient software systems.
In my years as a developer at various technology companies, I have worked on a wide array of technologies like embedded systems, networking, device drivers, cloud, databases and web technologies. I've recently moved to freelancing and blogging.

I have been programming for as far back as I can remember. Started with the C programming language way back in 1996 - and over the years, I've learnt and worked on many other programming languages - C++, Java, Python, PHP, Javascript, Shell to name a few. I believe that it's not just the knowledge of a programming language that makes a good developer - it's the thorough understanding of the whole ecosystem surounding the programming language (the platform, libraries, tools etc), in addition to having a very good grounding in the basic principles of software design and engineering. 
I have a very keen interest in technology in general and I like to keep myself updated to the latest developments in tech. Even though I've worked on embedded systems and computer networking through the better part of my career, I've deliberately drifted towards web and cloud technologies over the course of last few years. But my interests are not limited to just the web or cloud or embedded tech - newer technologies like AI, ML & Block Chain excite me. And so I keep it a point to keep learning something new everyday, and this blog is just a small attempt to share what I've learnt. I hope to make the complex part of tech more easily palatable for the readers. And as they say "Simplicity is about subtracting the obvious and adding the meaningful.", I do hope to keep my blogs simple, straight to the point and meaningful.
